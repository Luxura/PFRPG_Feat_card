# PFRPG_Feat_card
A json file with Feat DB for Pathfinder RPG, it's used with this project https://crobi.github.io/rpg-cards/ to generate feat card.

Due to some formating issue, most feat have much longer description than other, I recommend using the setting below for generating/printing the card, although most the card can be used with the standard format (2.5"x3.5").
  
  Page settings: 
   Page Size: A4
   Card Size: 3.5"x5.0"
   Cards/page: 2x2

Etape 1: Chose and download one/all of the file,

Etape 2: Go to https://crobi.github.io/rpg-cards/ and use the "Load from file" option,

Etape 3: In the "Arrangement field" chose the "Side by side" or "Front side only".

Etape 4: Click Generate.
