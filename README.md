# PFRPG_Feat_card
A json file with Feat DB for Pathfinder RPG, it's used with this project http://crobi.github.io/rpg-cards/generator/generate.html to generate feat card.

Due to some formating issue, certain feat have much longer description than other, I recommend using the setting below for generating/printing the card, although most the card can be used with the standard format (2.5"x3.5").
  
  Page settings: 
   Page Size: A4
   Card Size: 3.5"x5.0"
   Cards/page: 2x2
