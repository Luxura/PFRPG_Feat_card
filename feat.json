To do so, use the normal grapple rules with the following changes. Attack: You cannot use your whip to attack while you are using it to grapple an opponent. Damage: When dealing damage to your grappled opponent, you deal your whip's weapon damage rather than your unarmed strike damage. Free Hands: You take no penalty on your combat maneuver check for having fewer than two hands free when you use your whip to grapple. Reach: Rather than pulling your grappled opponent adjacent to you when you successfully grapple and when you move the grapple, you must keep him within your whip's reach minus his own reach to maintain the grapple. If the difference in reach is less than 0, such as is the case for a Medium whip wielder and a Gargantuan creature, you cannot grapple that opponent with your whip. If you have to pull a creature adjacent to you to grapple it with your whip, you still provoke an attack of opportunity from that opponent unless you have the Improved Grapple feat. Tie Up: While adjacent to your opponent, you can attempt to use your whip to tie him up. If you do so to an opponent you have grappled rather than pinned, you take only a -5 penalty on the combat maneuver check rather than the normal -10."

			"text | Whenever you are within 15 feet of another character who has this feat, you can ready an action to activate a simple blast of your choice. When that character unleashes a simple blast, yours is triggered, creating a composite blast for which the two simple blasts meet the prerequisites. The composite blast's caster level is equal to the average of the caster levels of both participants and deals damage as the  appropriate composite blast created by a kineticist of that level (for example, if a 10th-level pyrokineticist and a 6th-level hydrokineticist worked together to create a steam blast, its base damage would be 4d6+4 points of fire damage and 4d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage).  One participant can provide a form infusion appropriate for the composite blast, and the other can provide an appropriate substance infusion. Each participant accepts the burn cost for the infusion she provided. The participant who didn't take the special ready action can apply a metakinesis to the blast, and she is the only one who can gather power to reduce the blast's cost (since only she has a move action to take prior to the blast). However, whatever metakinesis she applies affects the entire composite blast.  If the two participants aren't adjacent to each other, the origin point of cones, lines, and other effects that normally originate from a character's square instead originate from a point in the square located halfway between the two participants in a straight line (where the two simple blasts meet and form the composite blast).  The blast uses the Constitution modifier of whoever provided the substance infusion and the Dexterity modifier of whoever provided the form infusion. If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided. If no infusions are used, the two kineticists choose one of them to provide the Dexterity modifier, and the other provides the Constitution modifier."

			"text | Immediately before casting a spell, as a swift action, you can attempt to augment a spell's casting using Arithmancy. To do so, determine the digital root of the name of the spell you are casting. To find the digital root of a spell name, first assign a numerical value to each letter of the name, per the Letter Values table. Once you have a string of digits, sum them. If the result has more than one digit, sum those digits. Repeat this process until you arrive at a single number, called the digital root. Once you've translated the name of the spell into a single digital root, attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell level + the digital root. If your check succeeds, the spell is cast at +1 caster level. If your check fails, the spell is cast at -1 caster level. If you do not cast the spell you intended to augment with arithmancy, the spell is expended with no effect, though you retain the action you would have spent to cast it. Metamagic effects are not included in a spell's name when determining the spell's digital root, but they increase the spell's level as normal when determining the DC of the Spellcraft check. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the number of caster levels you possess. For example, Ezren wants to use Arithmancy to cast an augmented fireball. First, he translates the spell name into numbers. Fireball translates to 6, 9, 9, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3. Then he calculates the digital root. In this case, 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 38, 3 + 8 = 11, and 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the digital root of fireball is 2. He then attempts a Spellcraft check against a DC of 15 (10 + 3 [fireball's spell level] + 2 [fireball's digital root]). If his check succeeds, he can cast the fireball this round at +1 caster level. If he fails, he can cast the spell at -1 caster level this round. He may also choose not to cast fireball and perform another action, though he expends the spell."

The attempt to hide the spell slows your casting slightly, such that spells that normally take a standard action to cast now take a full-round action, and spells that normally take longer than a standard action take twice as long. (Swift action spells still take a swift action.) To discover your ruse, a creature must succeed at a Perception, Sense Motive, or Spellcraft check (the creature receives an automatic check with whichever of those skills has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Disguise (whichever is higher) + your Charisma modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing.  If your spell has a somatic component, any creature that can see you receives a Perception or Spellcraft check (whichever has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Sleight of Hand + your Dexterity modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing.  Since you are concealing the spell's manifestation through other actions, others observing you realize you're doing something, even if they don't realize you're casting a spell. If there is a verbal component, they still hear your  loud, clear voice but don't notice the spell woven within. If an opponent fails its check, your casting also does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and an opponent that fails its check can't use readied actions that depend on realizing that you're casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, or readied actions such as counterspelling that require identifying the spell you're casting. Spells such as fireball that create an additional obvious effect (aside from the manifestation of casting that all spells and spell-like abilities share) still create that effect, though it might not be obvious who cast the spell unless it emanates from you.  If a character interacts with you long enough to attempt a Sense Motive check without realizing you have been casting spells, that character can use Sense Motive to gain a hunch that you're behaving unusually."

You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature.  If you expend 150 gp worth of alchemical reagents per die of the bomb's damage (for example, 750 gp for a 5d6 bomb), the bomb does not automatically detonate after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature dies or is destroyed (24 hours after implantation, this bomb no longer counts toward your daily total).  Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by magic or abilities such as regeneration or fast healing. Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a Heal check to treat deadly wounds, followed by a dispel magic spell or Disable Device check to neutralize the bomb (DC = 11 + alchemist's caster level)."

For instance, if a 4th-level oracle of life with the spirit boost revelation heals a 4th-level fighter with this feat, up to 6 points of healing could become temporary hit points for the fighter (the oracle's caster level + 1/2 the fighter's level)."

You perform an 8-hour ritual that requires the expenditure of 200 gp for rare oils, incense, and creation of a special mask. After this ritual, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you (including any identities that you gain from class abilities). You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. Your title must not reference the names of any people or places. (For example, you could adopt the title \"Blue Fox\" or \"Twilight Stalker,\" but not the title \"Chelish Avenger\" or \"Spirit of the Mwangi.\") At the ritual's conclusion, you must don the mask created for the ritual, the appearance of which is evocative of your title. While you're wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist. Successful Knowledge checks to identify you reveal your new title rather than any old identity, but can reveal your strengths and weaknesses normally. As long as you wear the ritual mask and do not reveal your connection to any past identities, any attempt to scry on you in relation to of your eschewed identities requires a successful caster level check with a DC of 10 + your Hit Dice. In addition, you are immune to effects that require the use of your name, such as the named bulletUC spell. While benefiting from this feat, you cannot wear any magic items in the head slot, as the mask used by this effect effectively occupies this slot (though this feat's benefits are not magical for the purpose of dispel magic and other effects). In addition, you cannot attempt to impersonate a specific individual by any means, magical or nonmagical. If you ever reveal or confirm your connection to your eschewed identities, you immediately lose the benefit of this feat and gain 1d4 permanent negative levels as your discarded identities return. You cannot regain the benefit of this feat or remove these negative levels until you atone (as per atonement, as if restoring a class feature)."

			"text | You gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (nobility) checks, and Knowledge (nobility) is always a class skill for you. You also gain an additional benefit depending on which family you belong to.  Basri: You come from the long line of ambassadors, diplomats, and travelers that make up the Basri, and  your family maintains the strongest ties to the elven nation of Kyonin of any Taldan humans. Select one of the following as a bonus starting language: Celestial, Elven, Gnome, Sylvan. You gain proficiency in one of the following weapons: longbow (including composite), longsword, rapier, or shortbow (including composite). If you gain proficiency in all martial weapons at 1st level, you can instead select elven curve blade.  Clement: Your Garundi and Mwangi ancestors served Taldor proudly during the Sixth Army of Exploration and were awarded titles for their service. Your family, which has maintained their noble titles to this day, is known for keen insights and biting observations. You can substitute your Wisdom modifier for your Charisma modifier when attempting Diplomacy skill checks.  Corcina: Your family came to prominence during the Second Army of Exploration, and maintains a legacy as explorers and sailors. You gain a +1 bonus on Climb and Escape Artist checks, and a +2 bonus on Survival checks to navigate.  Karthis: Yours is a family of distinguished military veterans, charismatic demagogues, and xenophobic zealots. As the rest of the family becomes increasingly Imperialist, you have made no effort to remain in their good graces, but you retain the skills they taught you during a childhood of rigorous training. You can apply your Charisma modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier to Initiative checks.  Kastner: Your stalwart family defines itself by opposing your devil-worshiping Chelish cousins, a grudge that inspired some of Taldor's greatest healers, priests, and negotiators. You gain one additional use per day of channel energy, lay on hands, or mesmerist tricks, or 3 additional rounds of bardic music per day. You gain only one of these benefits, even if you later acquire a second class that provides one of the other class features listed.  Lotheed: Your family ranks include the greatest wizards and arcane scholars in Taldor, and schooling in some of the most comprehensive arcane libraries in the Inner Sea was your birthright. If your Intelligence is 11 or higher, you gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day-dancing lights, prestidigitation, read magic, unseen servant. The caster level for these effects is equal to one-half your class level.  Merosett: The cunning members of your large family, a longtime fixture in Oppara's bureaucracy, specialize in tracking lineages and sidestepping red tape. You gain a +5 bonus on Bluff checks to send secret messages and Sense Motive checks to discern secret messages. You halve the time required to search through archives, navigate government offices, review contracts, or otherwise work  with the complex bureaucracies your family has mastered for generations.  Stavian: As a close relative of the Grand Prince, yours has been a life of material comfort and indulgence, colored by constant threats and direct influence. You gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and on Will saves against enchantment spells of the charm and compulsion subschools.  Talbot: Your starkly conservative family are merchants and entrepreneurs first and aristocrats second, willing to forgo duty if they can instead pursue profit. They condemn would-be adventurers and readily oust them from the family ranks, leaving you an outcast. You gain a +2 bonus on one Profession skill of your choice. Once per day, you can use this Profession skill in place of a single Knowledge skill check.  Varima: Your family immigrated to Taldor from Vudra hundreds of years ago, and thanks to noble roots, extensive trade contacts, and an unparalleled skill in negotiation, soon developed into a steadfast fixture of Oppara's social scene. Whenever you use Diplomacy to influence a crowd or a room (but not individuals), you can roll twice and use the better result.  Vernisant: Your family is descended from the great general Arnisant, who commanded Taldan forces during the Shining Crusade... and they will never let anyone forget it! Their fierce Imperialist support and nationalist fervor has left you alienated from your relatives now, but their emphasis on scholarship left a mark nonetheless. You gain a +1 bonus on all Knowledge skills in which you have at least 1 rank.  Vinmark: Newcomers and outsiders, your Ulfen family was exalted to nobility 19 years ago, when Stavian III promoted your family patriarch to Baron of Oppara as a reward for service in the Ulfen Guard. Established aristocrats consider your family crude, choosing to leave them on the margins of Taldan politics unless a noble thinks they could use you to curry favor with the Grand Prince, but hard-won practicality and newborn cynicism grant you insight most Taldan nobles lack. Once per day when rolling a Sense Motive check, you may roll two dice and use the better result.  Zespire: Your family runs charities and lobbies heavily for social reform, leaving them with few friends among their Opparan peers but heartfelt support from the common folk and lesser nobility. You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Perform checks when dealing with common citizens and with nobles whose titles are limited to Lord, Lady, Knight, or Dame."

Targets under the effects of protection from evil, or related spells, gain a bonus to this save. Should a target succeed at its Will save, the fiend is forced back into its natural form and is stunned for 1 round. A fiend that successfully possesses a target enters its space and merges with it. While possessing a creature or object, a fiend's body and abilities are unavailable. Once a fiend merges with its target it cannot be harmed until it leaves or is forcibly removed. While possessing a target, a fiend shares the senses of its host and can communicate with it telepathically. A fiend also gains a number of possession points per day equal to its total Hit Dice. These points can be spent to utilize special bodily possession actions detailed on the following pages. A fiend may expend these points as it pleases, with each possession action taking a full-round action. Each day, the victim of a possession is allowed a new Will save at the original DC to force the possessing fiend to leave its body-objects and areas do not receive daily saves. Should a victim make this save or be killed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in an adjacent space, and is stunned for 1 round. A fiend may not possess a new target for 24 hours after being ejected from a victim. Dispel evil (or dispel chaos or dispel law, depending on the fiend) can eject a fiend, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier.

An area receives no save against fiendish possession unless creatures or magical items occupy the space, in which case the area makes a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier using the stats of the occupant with the highest Will save. An area within the effects of a hallow spell cannot be possessed. A fiend possessing an area operates similarly to one using the Possess Creature feat, except that locations do not receive daily saves to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's possession points can only be spent on location possession actions.

			"text | When you take this feat, select two metamagic feats you do not yet have. When casting a spell, you can perform the steps below to spontaneously apply the effects of either or both of these metamagic feats, as well as any other metamagic feats you have, to the spell without expending a higher-level spell slot. Using a feat in this way increases the spell's casting time to the casting time it would take if the character were a sorcerer or bard (sorcerers and bards using this ability increase the spell's casting time by two categories; see page 113 of the Core Rulebook); applying the Quicken Spell metamagic effect negates the increased casting time but still contributes to the modified spell's effective spell level. You can take this feat more than once; each time, select two additional metamagic feats, adding their effects to the list of possible effects you can apply to spells with this ability. When casting a spell using Sacred Geometry, first determine the effective spell level of the modified spell you are attempting to cast (calculated as normal for a spell modified by metamagic feats). You can apply any number of metamagic effects to a single spell, provided you are able to cast spells of the modified spell's effective spell level. Refer to the Prime Constants table to determine the prime constants that can be used to cast a spell of the desired effective spell level. Then roll a number of d6s equal to the number of ranks you possess in Knowledge (engineering). Perform some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division upon the numbers rolled that gives rise to one of the relevant prime constants. If you can produce one of the relevant prime constants, the spell takes effect with the declared metamagic effects, and you expend a spell slot of the unaltered spell's level. If you are unsuccessful, you fail to cast the spell, the action used to cast the spell is lost, and the spell slot is used up. The DC of any concentration check to cast a spell affected by this feat uses the effective spell level used to determine the prime constants, even though a successful casting of the spell does not expend a higher-level spell slot. For example, suppose Ezren wants to add the enlarged and empowered effects to the magic missile he just cast. He adds the total level increases of the metamagic effects to the spell level: 2 [empower] + 1 [enlarge] + 1 [magic missile's base level] = 4, so the spell's effective level is 4. Ezren refers to the Prime Constants table, and determines that the prime constants for that effective spell level are 31, 37, and 41. Since Ezren has 5 ranks in Knowledge (engineering), he rolls 5d6. The results of his dice pool are 6, 6, 4, 3 and 1. He then performs the following operations to give rise to one of the prime constants he needs: (6 x 6) + (4 - 3) x 1 = 37. Note that he could also combine the numbers as follows: ([6 + 6] x 3) + 4 + 1 = 41. He has produced one of the prime constants for the desired effective spell level, so his empowered enlarged magic missile takes effect after the full-round casting time, and uses only a 1st-level spell slot. If the result of Ezren's dice pool were 1, 1, 2, and 5, he would have been unable to produce any of the relevant prime constants. His attempt would have been unsuccessful, and he would have expended a full-round action and his prepared 1st-level magic missile spell with no effect."

			"text | A number of times per day equal to your base Fortitude save bonus, you can cause a holy symbol of a deity you worship and whose alignment is the same as yours to unleash a harmful magical attack called a symbolic bolt. This attack can be delivered via touch or a ray, as a standard action. A melee symbolic bolt requires a melee touch attack that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, and a ranged symbolic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. A symbolic bolt deals damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 your total number of ranks in the Use Magic Device skill. You choose the type of damage dealt by your symbolic bolt each time you use this feat from those offered by the cleric domains granted by the deity whose holy symbol you use. The types of damage (and the cleric domains that grant them) are acid (Earth, Magic, Rune), cold (Darkness, Magic, Rune, Void, Water, Weather), electricity (Air, Magic, Rune, Weather), fire (Destruction, Fire, Magic, Rune), negative energy (Death, Destruction, Void), positive energy (Glory, Healing, Repose, Sun), sonic (Magic, Rune, Weather), and untyped (any). If a symbolic bolt is used to deal untyped damage, the bolt's damage is reduced to an amount equal to 1d3 + 1/2 your total number of ranks in Use Magic Device.  When you create a symbolic bolt, it originates from the hand holding the holy symbol and appears only briefly, so  you have a hand free anytime you're not attacking with a symbolic bolt. The feat Weapon Focus (ray) doesn't apply to symbolic bolts, but you can take the feat Weapon Focus (symbolic bolt) and apply it to both melee and ranged symbolic bolts. Spells that target a single weapon (such as magic weapon) can't affect symbolic bolts, nor can a symbolic bolt have magic weapon special abilities. Abilities and feats that affect all weapon attacks function as normal with symbolic bolts."

			"text | Your researches into ancient tomes and your inquisitions of bound spirits have led you to one of the best-hidden secrets of the multiverse: the true name of an outsider-the name that defines the very essence of the creature and that gives the speaker control over the being. This outsider can have no more than 12 Hit Dice. Once per day, you can speak the common name by which the outsider is known, and the outsider travels to you as if you had cast planar binding upon it. It must obey you to the best of its ability, without pay or bargaining for its services, for its fear that you might release its true name to the wider world is enough to bring even the most recalcitrant of outsiders to bear.  If the creature is within 100 feet, as a move action, you may punish it by deliberately mispronouncing its name, wracking its very essence and giving it the sickened and staggered conditions for 1 round (even if the creature is normally immune to these conditions). You cannot use true name in an area of silence, but the creature does not have to be able to hear you for it to be harmed by the ability.  It is in your best interest to call this creature only sparingly, and occasionally reward it in some fashion to mollify its wrath. If you repeatedly fail to offer it a reward appropriate to its type and ethos, the creature may begin plotting ways to destroy the bond between you, whether by creating an accident that will destroy your memory of the name, by plaguing you with nuisances or dangers until you vow never to call on it again, or by actively seeking to destroy you through its own devices or those of an underling. If this creature is of a lawful type and you are violating its ethos, its superiors may even destroy it or you rather than allow you to contaminate their servant further. Worse, they may establish situations where it is necessary for you to summon this outsider, opening gateways to infernal or angelic interference, in order to gain a foothold on the Material Plane.  This is a spell-like ability."

The animal rises from death in 1d4 days as a vampiric animal bonded with the vampire who spawned it. Thereafter, the vampiric animal advances in abilities like a normal animal companion as the vampire gains further class levels in the class that granted the animal companion. In order to gain a dire rat as a vampiric companion, a vampire's effective druid level must be 4th. To gain a wolf as an vampiric companion, the vampire's effective druid level must be 6th.

This feat is similar to Leadership, except Vile Leadership rewards-rather than punishes-leaders with cruel reputations or who cause their followers' deaths. Once you take this feat, you cannot take the Leadership feat without retraining your feat selection (Ultimate Campaign 191).  Numerous factors can affect your Vile Leadership score (which acts as a Leadership score for the purpose of feats and abilities that rely on a Leadership score, other than Leadership itself ); work in conjunction with your GM and use the tables below to adjust your Vile Leadership score accordingly. The NPCs you attract must be of a nongood alignment.  Vile Leadership Modifiers: Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Vile Leadership score.  Leader's Reputation Modifier  Ruthless +2  Rewards loyalty or success +1  Possesses a special power +1  Indecisive -1  Tolerant of failure -1  Merciful -2  Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort with this feat, as listed below.  Leader's Attributes Modifier  Gained power by eliminating a superior +1  Fails to punish or kill minions who make -2*  costly mistakes  Recruits a cohort of a different alignment -1  * Cumulative per incident of compassion shown. This penalty is incurred even if you show mercy to avoid killing or punishing more than 20% of your minions during a given character level (see the footnote in the following table).  Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers.  Leader's Attributes Modifier  Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, etc. +2  Has punished or killed minions to set an example +1*  or assert dominance  Has a tendency toward long periods of inactivity -1  Restricts minions from looting, pillaging, or pursing -1  other spoils of war  * Cumulative to a maximum bonus of +1 per character level. If you punish or kill more than 20% of your minions during a given character level, this bonus becomes a penalty instead. When you gain a new level, any bonus or penalty from punishing or killing minions resets to 0."

Whenever you encounter a recently neutralized haunt, the remains of an incorporeal undead creature, or the remains of a creature that has the ability to possess another creature using a racial spell-like ability or supernatural ability (such as a ghost or a shadow demon), you can attempt to extract material components from those remains that are suitable for crafting magic items. You must have access to an alchemist's lab (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 76) in order to extract components from a haunt or creature, and you must begin extracting these components within 10 minutes of the haunt or creature's death or destruction. After 10 minutes, the components have degraded too much to be of any use to you.  Harvesting components with this feat can take several hours. Performing at least 1 minute of work extracting components from a haunt or creature prevents its material components from degrading further for 24 hours, allowing you to safely suspend and resume harvesting these components without fear of subsequent degradation. This ectoplasmic residue is portable once the extraction work begins, provided you have a vial to contain the source residue (the actual amount of residue is never much, physically, but the value of the components you can extract from the residue increases with the power of the original haunt or creature).  Each hour, attempt a Craft (alchemy) or a Knowledge (religion) check to successfully handle the residue and extract useful material. The DC for this check is equal to 15 + the CR of the haunt or creature being harvested. If you succeed at the check, you harvest 50 gp worth of components. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you can attempt to harvest those components again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the residue spoils and you cannot scavenge any more from that particular source. A single source can yield an amount of components up to a maximum value of 50 gp per point of CR before it is depleted.  Material components harvested with Haunt Scavenger can be used in place of the material components of enchantment or necromancy spells and extracts, provided they are of equal or greater value compared to the spell's normal material components. Additionally, they can be used in place of actual gold to fund the construction of a magic item with an enchantment or necromancy aura."

When making a mounted charge, you can guide your mount to leap over a foe between your starting position and the target of your charge. You make a Ride check or your mount makes an Acrobatics check (whichever is lower) during the charge, using the rules for the leap task under the Ride skill. If the height you clear with that check exceeds the creature's height, you jump over it and continue your charge on the opposite side. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, you can vault over your target while making a Ride-By Attack, allowing you to move over or through its space and continue moving on the opposite side of it. If your jump exceeds the target's height, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll for higher ground, and if any of your allies threatens the target, you treat the target as flanked for purposes of your Ride-By Attack."
